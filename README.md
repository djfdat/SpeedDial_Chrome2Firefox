# SpeedDial_Chrome2Firefox

##About
Helps convert the backup data produced from [Speed Dial 2](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speed-dial-2/jpfpebmajhhopeonhlcgidhclcccjcik?hl=en) on Chrome into a importable settings document for [Speed Dial](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/speed-dial/) on Firefox.

For detailed directions, see [Production Testing](https://cdn.rawgit.com/djfdat/SpeedDial_Chrome2Firefox/master/index.html)

No longer in development.

## Issues
Some dials get swapped around, and not everything is transferred over. Works well enough to move over the bulk of the work but requires additional setup for some things. Feel free to make pull requests if you feel the need to fix this.
